* [MAE](https://code.google.com/p/mae-annotation/) (Multi-purpose Annotation Environment) is an annotation tool created by Amber Stubbs (http://amberstubbs.net) for Brandeis University for use in her dissertation research. It is a lightweight program written in Java, with a MySQLite database back end (SQLiteJDBC driver created by David Crawshaw (http://www.zentus.com/sqlitejdbc/)).
